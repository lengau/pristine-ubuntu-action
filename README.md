# Pristine Ubuntu

This action is a work-in-progress, but its purpose is to undo most of the changes that
GitHub makes to the Ubuntu images, returning to something more similar to a standard
Ubuntu.

This will not remove the dependencies needed to run actions,so `setup-*` actions should
still work after running this.
